# Hello-world
I'm a Cybersecurity Engineer branching into SW. I will be first doing personal tutorial like projects to get back to speed with programming as Iâ€™ve not been doing much since university (Python Mainly). As soon as i get to be operational (not necessarily master) i will be contributing to the best of my capabilities to projects I find interesting (learning along the way).
