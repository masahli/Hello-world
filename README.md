# Hello-world
This Mohamed Aymen SAHLI, I'm a Network Engineer branching into SW. I will be first doing personal tutorial like projects to get back to speed with programming as Iâ€™ve not being doing much since university (C/C++/Python). As soon as i get to be operational (not necessarily master) i will be contributing to the best of my capabilities to projects I find interesting (learning along the way).
